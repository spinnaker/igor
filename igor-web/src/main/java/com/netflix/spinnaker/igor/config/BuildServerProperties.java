     * In the example above, users with the foo or bar roles will be able to see <code>someProvider-host1</code> and use
     * it as a trigger, users with the bar role will additionally be able to trigger builds on the CI host. Users
     * without these roles will not see <code>someProvider-host1</code> in Spinnaker at all. All users will be able to
     * access <code>someProvider-host2</code> without limitations.
